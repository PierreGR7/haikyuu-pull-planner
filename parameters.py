# Here we will define the parameters for the calculator
# (my game is in french, so I'm not sure to ahev the correct names for all the missions)

# UR ticket = 150 Gems
gems_per_pull = 150 

# Daily income
# For this variable, we will use the minimum value of gems we can get from the daily missions
# I used the video of "Guillaume in Game", french youtuber that calculated the amount of gems in this video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f1CCP3rw6E
# Daily missions complete : 60 gems
# Training program : 85 gems
# Free time : 30 gems (minimum)
# Summit challenge : 15 gems
# PVP daily standing : 10 gems (minimum)
# Total = 60 + 85 + 30 + 15 + 10 = 200 gems
daily_income = 200

# Weekly income
# I used the same video as for the daily income : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f1CCP3rw6E
# Weekly missions complete : 100 gems
# Free time (chill games) : 150 gems
# CLubs benefits : 50 gems
# Weekend bonus : 120 gems
# Specialty tests, it depends on the difficulty of the test. The best technique is to not finish the normal test, and to farm every week the maximum of 380 gems
# Total = 100 + 150 + 50 + 120 + 380 = 800 gems
weekly_income = 800

# Monthly income
# I used the same video as for the weekly and daily income : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f1CCP3rw6E
# PvP ranking (easy to reach the highest level) : 350 gems
# Match streak (2x per month) : 2 x 640 = 1280 gems
# Updates compensation : 150 gems
# Calendar : 50 gems
# Total = 350 + 1280 + 150 + 50 = 1830 gems
monthly_income = 1830

# Banner tickets
# For each banner we have missions to complete :
# logins events : 1Around 10 UR tickets
# Missions banner : 5 UR tickets to buy with the event "money"
banner_tickets = 15
